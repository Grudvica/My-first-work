        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Hello stranger!</strong>&nbsp; Welcome on my very first web page. <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know the people who are always <strong>positive</strong>, who are smiling almost always when u meet them,
         from who u won't hear any heavy words directed to you or anybody else...? <br> 
         Who lives with full heart, who loves with full heart and who are leaded by the heart?
         Yeah, that's my kind of people, <br> I call them <strong>dreamers</strong>.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm <strong>Milica</strong>. I'm 25 years old girl from <strong>Serbia</strong> . The name of my city is Novi Sad,
            the place where I live since I was born. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I finished elementary and general high school here, too.
            I went to University, Faculty of Science, where I studied biochemistry and on the third year I gave up.
            The reason why I gave up from it, its not because i don't like biochemistry. For me thats one preety cool and interesting 
            science, which has fundamental meaning for all of us and all other living world on our planet. I just couldn't accept
            the work system where I have to just cramp up, to learn something that big and serious without logic,
            just to pass the exams. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Then, I spent some time just figuring out what else I want to do in my life. 
            I started doing things that I <strong><em>love</em></strong> and <strong><em>enjoy</em></strong> the most. The funniest thing is that I like <em>healthy-active lifestyle</em>
            and <em>playing games</em> on my PC the most. Who said that I can't have both? So I go to nutrition school, 
            have sports-activity for few times a week and play games when I have enough time for it. <br>
            My Love for PCs is very big so I enrolled the course of programming and now I write code for my first web page. I,m feeling great and I hope u like it.
            There is a lot of things that I have to learn, to become serious web developer, but I'm totally ready to study and can't wait
            to see where this is going to lead me...
